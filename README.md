## Business Problem 
It is desired to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified. You are expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps before developing the model.
## Dataset
The dataset is part of the large dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in the USA. Data used for diabetes research on Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city of the State of Arizona in the USA. The target variable is specified as "outcome"; 1 indicates positive diabetes test result, 0 indicates negative.
